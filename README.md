#  Summer Analytics 2024 – Week 1 Assignment: Data Grand Prix!

Welcome to my submission for Week 1 of Summer Analytics 2024 by C&A. This assignment focused on applying basic data analysis skills using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.

##  Dataset
The dataset used is `Cars.csv`, which contains specifications of cars from the 1970s and 1980s, including:
- `mpg` (Miles per gallon)
- `cylinders`, `displacement`, `horsepower`
- `weight`, `acceleration`, `model_year`, `origin`, `name`

##  Tasks Performed
- Imported the dataset and handled missing values (e.g., filled missing `horsepower` values with the median)
- Generated descriptive statistics
- Visualized relationships using:
  - Pairplot
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Line plot of MPG trend by model year
  - Bar plot of average MPG by origin
  - Count plot for car distribution by origin

##  Key Insights
- **Japanese cars** have the highest average fuel efficiency.
- **MPG increased steadily** from 1970 to 1982.
- **Negative correlation** found between MPG and horsepower, weight, and displacement.

##  Libraries Used
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

##  How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the notebook and dataset.
2. Open `Summer_Analytics_Week1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Make sure `Cars.csv` is in the same directory.
4. Run all cells.
